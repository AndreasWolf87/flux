  # cat=basic/enable; type=boolean; label=Error handling: If enabled, all Flux controllers are permitted to handle their own errors in ways that are far more flexible than traditional error catching. Enable with care - if your plugin, content or page template collection does not contain an Error.html template, your site may risk breaking with an extremely basic and not very informative error รก la "Template not found for action foobar" but when enabled and combined with proper error templates you can customise pretty much any error which might happen anywhere when a Flux controller subclass is in play. Best turned off on development sites unless you are developing exactly error templates as it greatly limits debug output!

  # cat=basic/enable; type=boolean; label=Automatic initialisation: If enabled, Flux will automatically create the TypoScript setup that is required to render Flux templates in the frontend, and will use it on every page. Unchecking this option instead registers a static TypoScript file which can be loaded as needed.
